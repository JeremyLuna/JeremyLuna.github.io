<h1>Shortcuts for Fourier Networks</h1>
<p>1. You don't need to do any more than one spectral pooling layer.</p>
<p>2. Half of the fourier transform is redundant! If only train across half, you no longer need to constrain your variables to represent real spatial values.</p>
<p>3. Multiply all intermediate layers once it's trained.</p>
<p>But... what good is a network without nonlinearities</p>
